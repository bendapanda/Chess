# Chess
Chess project I have been working on, written in Java. The end goal is to try and build in an ai for the player to face off against.

## Construction
The project consists of 3 main classes:
- Display
- Piece
- Board

  ### Display
  This class is responsible for displaying the board and getting user input
  ### Piece
  Abstract class that controls what pieces are what and what each piece can do.
  ### Board
  Controls the analysis and movement of pieces. Makes sure all moves are legal.
